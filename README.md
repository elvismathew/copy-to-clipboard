# Clipboard Copy with JavaScript
This project demonstrates how to create a web page that can copy text to the clipboard using vanilla JavaScript, without relying on any frameworks. Prior knowledge of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is recommended. Key JavaScript concepts involved include DOM manipulation and functions.

# Project Overview
The web page contains an SSH key already set as the value of a text field. When the user clicks the button with the clone icon, the SSH key is copied to the clipboard, allowing the user to paste it anywhere they need.
